Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2021

    Day 1: 16 May 2021. Sunday

    Today's Progress: Worked on pattern based question on C++

    Thoughts: Feels good to be back at coding, though some of the questions were easy , but it really feels good to be back

    Link to work: [pattern based question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/7cf1439cac8db304cd0cf996655976e1956fe1fa#diff-1fd38d5cbd2a997b91f725cb1cb0a710849db30dac491ee42e92443fd8e3c1a2)

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Day 2: 17 May 2021. Monday

    Today's Progress: Worked on more pattern based question on C++

    Thoughts: Feels good to be coding again , in between got bored a bit , and then got some tricky question to solve on pattern as well.

    Link to work: [pattern based question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/e9c5b5fac31f44d5403f486b225c33937e56d06c)

    -------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 3: 18 May 2021. Tuesday

    Today's Progress: Worked on fuctions based question on C++

    Thoughts: Feels good to do some higher level of question ,as fuction is very important concept in coding 

    Link to work: [fuction based question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/d9d649fbaa31c4ae2d7d87a62b5bd96d8713185e)

    -------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 4: 20 May 2021. Thursday

    Today's Progress: Worked on functions based searching linear/binary question on C++

    Thoughts: Feels good , did some questions of binary/linear search as this is very important , also viewd the classes on Time Complexity

    Link to work: [array search based question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/371b4cd3e5556d5ed64b63096adcc32c052b54ea)

    -------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 5: 21 May 2021. Friday

    Today's Progress: Worked on selection and bubble sorting algo on C++

    Thoughts: Feels good , did some  algo sorting  based question of selection and bubble sort

    Link to work: [sorting  question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/709fe3616d6514cc86584ef26f3321733773c07d)


-------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 6: 22 May 2021. saturday

    Today's Progress: Worked on insertion sorting algo and some arrays based questions on C++

    Thoughts: Feels good , did some insertion  algo sorting  and on array

    Link to work: [sorting and array question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/a5f74e97d1357af5c46052cf4e04c6a893e0810b)


-------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 7: 23 May 2021. sunday

    Today's Progress: Worked on compitetive questions based on array and subarrays on C++


    Thoughts: the questions level is preety good, u have to think before u code , as they r a bit tricky
    Link to work: [sub-array question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/f09333b439555d51da82ed468a2c88b1e53a335d)

-------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 8: 25 May 2021. tuesday

    Today's Progress: Worked on compititive questions based on array and subarrays on C++. i.e smallest-positive-missing-number and subarray-with-given-number.


    Thoughts: the questions level is preety good, u have to think before u code , as they r a bit tricky, but it feels good to solve a tricky question

    Link to work: [competitive array based question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/4a0195d8e0bc1b169eff02a400ce5d9544311d6d)

-------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 9: 26 May 2021. Wednesday

    Today's Progress: Worked on some questions based  subarrays on C++. i.e sdisplay all sub arrays and maximum sum of subarrays.


    Thoughts: the questions level is preety good, worked on subarrays , now ill learn a better less time complexity approach.

    Link to work: [sub array based question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/cbd5892f3e1fcdc21d52bf050203d10dc637f057)

-------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 10: 27 May 2021. Thursday

    Today's Progress: Worked on questions based on maximum sum of subarrays with different time complexity on C++ , solved with a help of kadane algo. 


    Thoughts: the questions level is preety good, worked on a same question with different time complexity.

    Link to work: [sub array based question](https://github.com/PranshuSharma1/cpp-complete/commit/ce5983f4df2d7e9573ad51386aff910ec602bee2)


-------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 11: 28 May 2021. Friday

    Today's Progress: Worked on questions based on maximum sum ofCircular  subarrays and also one sum pair problem with time complexity o(n) on C++ , solved with a help of kadane algo. 


    Thoughts: the questions level is preety good, the kadane algo is great way to solve problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Day 12: 30 May 2021. Sunday

    Today's Progress: Worked on questions based on 2-D matrix , also solved the spiral order tarversal display of matrix . 


    Thoughts: really loved thi problem , its a bit tricky but solving it is a fun.
