Day 1: 16 May 2021. Sunday

Today's Progress: Worked on pattern based question on C++

Thoughts: Feels good to be back at coding, though some of the questions were easy , but it really feels good to be back

Today's Progress: Worked on more pattern based question on C++

Thoughts: Feels good to be coding again , in between got bored a bit , and then got some tricky question to solve on pattern as well.
