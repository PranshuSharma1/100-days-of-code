Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2016
Day 1: June 13. Monday

Today's Progress: Spent time fixing CSS and figuring out how canvas works.

Thoughts: Feels good to be back at coding.

Link to work: Pomodoro Clock App
Day 2: June 14 Tuesday

Today's Progress: More progress on the canvas of the Pomodoro Clock. Worked on CSS (still figuring out Flexbox things), have done some work with HTML5 canvas.

Thoughts: It's a bit frustrating to spend a lot of time figuring out how the canvas works.

Day 3: June 15 Wednesday

Today's Progress: Mostly worked on CSS. Coded very late at night, after French.

Thoughts: Had some CSS breakthroughs, and was happy at the end.

Day 4: June 16 Thursday

Today's Progress: Have spent a lot of time debugging the drawing functions of the timer. Grandfather called (which is great), and I had to code later at night than planned.

Thoughts: Felt frustrated.

Day 5: June 17 Friday

Today's Progress: Fixed css issues, layout and switching between rest and work for the timer. There are little fixes to be done to the timer, but the main functionality works.

Thoughts: It's Friday, so even though we came home late (we have our first wedding anniversary) I was able to put in my hour. At first it was a bit frustrating, but in the end I got a lot done.

Day 6: June 18 Saturday

Today's Progress: Analyzed and improved increase/decrease session/break functionality, fixed some canvas display bugs.

Thoughts: I was coding at the FreeCodeCamp meeting which felt really good because usually I just talk there.

Day 7: June 19 Sunday

Today's Progress: Worked on canvas recognizing the display - retina vs regular, and some css work. I've managed to make it adapt to the kind of display it is used on, but there are still some small css issues to fix.

Thoughts: I've made myself code even though I didn't want to do it so late at night on Sunday. Proud of myself today.

Day 8: June 20 Monday

Today's Progress: Finished working on the Pomodoro Clock App and pushed it out.

Thoughts: Very happy with my progress, and excited to start new projects.

Day 9: June 21 Tuesday

Today's Progress: Created a repo that serves as a rule framework and a log (journal) that anyone can fork to start the 100DaysOfCode challenge and to track their progress

Thoughts: Excited to be able to answer questions and formalize the process of taking on the challenge and progressing through it!

Day 10: June 22 Wednesday

Today's Progress: Setting things up for the new Twitch TV project

Thoughts: Feeling good about this project, should be a bit simpler than Pomodoro Clock was.

Day 11: June 23 Thursday

Today's Progress: Working on sending requests to Twitch TV API, receiving object info and storing it.

Thoughts: Interesting to be working with an API, but sometimes the process of figuring out how to get the data correctly feels a bit too slow.

Day 12: June 24 Friday

Today's Progress: Introduced myself to Gulp (for SCSS build), and learnt the basics of how it works, fixed channel info storing.

Thoughts: Very excited to finally work with Gulp and SCSS! I think that I've had an illusion of that being too difficult, when in reality, it turned out to be manageable.

Day 13: June 25 Saturday

Today's Progress: Figured out the issues I had with gulp not exporting css properly. I've also found a way to make gulp create a CSS file out of SCSS on every save of the file. After that, I've looked into connecting the github pages repository to my own domain. I've had issues with that before, but now was able to set everything up in such a way that my kallaway.github.io site works on the www.kallaway.io domain. Most of the settings had to be done on the domain registrar site.

Thoughts: Feel great about finally figuring out a way to use Github pages for my site.

Day 14: June 26 Sunday

Today's Progress: Worked on displaying the results of API requests to TwitchTV

Thoughts: Progress on this feels slow, but it's fun to construct how exactly the response should be displayed.

Day 15: June 27 Monday

Today's Progress: Worked on appending the results to the page in the right way using jQuery. Understood that I should refresh my jQuery knowledge to be more effective in this project. I will do that on the subway by watching CodeSchool videos on jQuery. Then, at home, I will just work on the project some more.

Thoughts: I am enjoying this, though I am always surprised how far my expectations of what the DOM results will be like actually end up looking when I reload the page.

Day 16: June 28 Tuesday

Today's Progress: I've gone through some jQuery refreshers during the day, and was able to detect past errors of working with the DOM incorrectly. This led to me being able to receive the data and display it in a nice way on the page, approaching the functionality of the example app. Design still needs a lot of work, and I am considering adding some more functionality to the app. Also looking at Jekyll for some personal site projects.

Thoughts: Happy with my progress today.
